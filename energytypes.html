			<h2>Wind Turbins</h2>
			<p style="opacity: 0.87;">Wind turbines are a type of power generator, consisting of several parts and being able to harvest energy through wind. Wind turns the blades of the wind turbines, which spins a shaft, connecting to a generator and then creating electricity. The actual blades, at the top of a large tower or pole, can reach higher wind speeds, as wind reaches higher speeds at higher altitudes. Wind turbines, however, have cons. Wind speeds are inconsistent, meaning that there may occasionally be times at which theyâ€™re not producing any power. Many wind turbines cost $2-$3 million dollars to be installed, and can usually generate around 3,285,000 kWh per year.</p>

  <a name="solar">
	<section id="solar" class="solar">
		<div class="content">
			<p style="opacity: 0.87;">Photovoltaic cells: Thin sheets of silicon that have been mixed with copper, hydrochloric acid, and other chemicals. They generate electricity by having their electrons knocked out of them by the energy of the sun. The electrons then flow through metal
				sheets to batteries or directly to the object in need of power.
				</p>

					<p>Pros: Clean, no pollution, becoming cheaper, renewable, not dangerous, sun powered, sun everywhere.</p>

					<p>Cons: Expensive, sun doesn&#0039;t fall equally on the earth, large, made of silicon, nighttime exists.</p>

		<h2>Hydro Energy</h2>
			<p style="opacity: 0.87;">Dams are built and a reservoir is formed. Water is allowed in from the reservoir through an intake and then flows down through a penstock. As the water rushes by, it turns the shaft of an electromechanical generator generating electricity in the powerhouse
				and the electricity is then used to power homes and businesses.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<h2>Nuclear Energy</h2>
			<p style="opacity: 0.87;">The nucleus of an atom is broken up when shot with a neutron. The atom then splits into two less massive nuclei, relatively massive amounts of energy, and some other neutrons. These neutrons repeat the cycle and cause a chain reaction. Control rods
				are used to absorb some neutrons to keep an uncontrolled reaction from taking place. The heat generated from this process is used to heat water, which then heats some other water into steam, which then turns the turbines of an electromechanical generator.</p>

		<h2>Geothermal Energy</h2>
			<p style="opacity: 0.87;">Holes are drilled into the ground and the hot water is pumped up, turns into steam, and then drives the turbines of the plant.</p>
