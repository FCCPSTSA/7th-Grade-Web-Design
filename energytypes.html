		<h2>Types of Alternative and Renewable Energy</h2>
		<p style="opacity: 0.87;">Today there are many types of Alternative and Renewable energy that can positively help our planet. If you scroll down you can read all of the types or you can click on one of the types below to be taken down to it.</p>

	<section id="wind" class="wind">
		<div class="content">
			<p style="opacity: 0.87;">A tower is made with an electromechanical generator at the top. There is a drive train connected to a shaft, and on the end of the shaft are several, rather large, rotor blades. When the wind blows, it turns the rotor blades of the wind turbine. The
				energy is transformed into rotational energy in the shaft and it then turns the drive train. As the drive train rotates, the shaft going into the generator also rotates, thus generating electricity.</p>

			<p>Pros: Clean, powered by wind, renewable, wind energy abundant</p>

			<p>Cons: Noisy, high initial cost, wind energy not available everywhere, not always windy, large</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section id="solar" class="solar">
		<div class="content">
			<p style="opacity: 0.87;">Photovoltaic cells: Thin sheets of silicon that have been mixed with copper, hydrochloric acid, and other chemicals. They generate electricity by having their electrons knocked out of them by the energy of the sun. The electrons then flow through metal
				sheets to batteries or directly to the object in need of power.
				<p>

					<p>Pros: Clean, no pollution, becoming cheaper, renewable, not dangerous, sun powered, sun everywhere.</p>

					<p>Cons: Expensive, sun doesn&#0039;t fall equally on the earth, large, made of silicon, nighttime exists.</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section id="hydro" class="hydro">
		<div class="content">
			<p style="opacity: 0.87;">Dams are built and a reservoir is formed. Water is allowed in from the reservoir through an intake and then flows down through a penstock. As the water rushes by, it turns the shaft of an electromechanical generator generating electricity in the powerhouse
				and the electricity is then used to power homes and businesses.</p>

			<p>Pros: Clean, powered by the water cycle, efficient, widely used.</p>

			<p>Cons: Flooding, destroy land, stop fish, environmental effects, large, expensive.</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section id="nuclear" class="nuclear">
		<div class="content">
			<p style="opacity: 0.87;">The nucleus of an atom is broken up when shot with a neutron. The atom then splits into two less massive nuclei, relatively massive amounts of energy, and some other neutrons. These neutrons repeat the cycle and cause a chain reaction. Control rods
				are used to absorb some neutrons to keep an uncontrolled reaction from taking place. The heat generated from this process is used to heat water, which then heats some other water into steam, which then turns the turbines of an electromechanical generator.</p>

			<p>Pros: Highly efficient, no greenhouse gasses, explosions are unlikely, plenty of fuel available, high safety standards.</p>

			<p>Cons: Radioactive by products without long term solutions, explosions and meltdowns are a possibility, expensive reactors, non-renewable</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section id="geothermal" class="geothermal">
		<div class="content">
			<p style="opacity: 0.87;">Holes are drilled into the ground and the hot water is pumped up, turns into steam, and then drives the turbines of the plant.</p>
			<p>Pros: Does not cause much pollution, renewable, has potential for large energy output,</p>

			<p>Cons: Plants are very expensive, must be built in a specifically good area.</p>
