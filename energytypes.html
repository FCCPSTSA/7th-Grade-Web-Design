				<h2>Wind Turbines</h2>
				<p style="opacity: 0.87;">Wind turbines are a type of power generator, consisting of several parts and being able to harvest energy through wind. Wind turns the blades of the wind turbines, which spins a shaft, connecting to a generator and then creating electricity. The actual blades, at the top of a large tower or pole, can reach higher wind speeds, as wind reaches higher speeds at higher altitudes. Wind turbines, however, have cons. Wind speeds are inconsistent, meaning that there may occasionally be times at which they&#39;re not producing any power. Many wind turbines cost $3-$4 million dollars to be installed, and can usually generate around 3,285,000 kWh per year.

				<h2>Solar Cells</h2>
				<p style="opacity: 0.87;">Solar power comes in the form of solar panels, consisting of solar cells, or photovoltaic cells. These cells are square shaped, and made from several materials, such as copper, silicon, and others. On contact with the cells, sunlight will release electrons, which creates an electric current. It is increasingly becoming one of the best energy source, with most harvested energy per year, becoming cheaper by the year, and will be cheaper per watt than coal in about 5-8 years. On average, it takes 13 years to create a 1gw nuclear power plant, whereas solar plants take about a year. In general, not only can solar plants be made quickly, but are becoming cheaper and produce a large amount of energy.

				<h2>Hydro Energy</h2>
				<p style="opacity: 0.87;">Hydroelectric power is derived from dams at which water flows downhill, and spins a turbine inside the dam. This spins the generator&#39;s shaft, which then spins a rotor creating electricity, much like the other sources of electricity listed. The dams only run during the day, and at night the water is pushed back into a water reservoir, as if left on, the water would run out. The water pushed back into the reservoir is then available to be used later on, and in most cases, the next day. Today, hydroelectric energy makes up 7% of the nation&#39;s energy production.

				<h2>Nuclear Energy</h2>
				<p style="opacity: 0.87;">Nuclear energy works with uranium atoms being split, releasing neutrons that begin to collide into other atoms. It creates &quot;fission&quot;, which can reach extremely high heats. Control rods are involved, absorbing neutrons to curb the reaction from becoming out of control, hence control rods. This heats up to 250 fahrenheit, which heats water, creating steam and spinning a turbine. Nuclear power isn&#39;t very well developed though, there being about 99 nuclear plants across the country. While nuclear power sounds good, it is not fully renewable. Nuclear power plants use uranium as a fuel, which is a nonrenewable resource. It is, however, clean, and does not release pollution.

				<h2>Geothermal Energy</h2>
				<p style="opacity: 0.87;">Harnessing geothermal energy starts with pumps, which go into the ground. These pumps contain air pipes for the hot air, and the pump itself, tapping the heat, or hot water, in terms of electricity. Underground, not only is the air hot, holding the potential to heat homes and buildings during the winter with solely pumps in the ground, but there&#39;s water, which is also kept hot by high underground temperatures. This hot water releases steam, which then turns a turbine, attached to a shaft and a generator, much like many of the other power sources above. Geothermal energy is an extremely powerful type of energy, and is imminent in the US and other countries, with 25% of Iceland&#39;s power coming from it alone. What makes geothermal powerful is the fact that it cannot run out, being that it comes from water, which can be recycled after use in the plant, but also produces a large amount of energy. With several plants running without end at the same time, geothermal energy&#39;s power production can overtake natural gasses, and even coal.

	<h2>Interview with a renewable/alternative energy proffesional</h2>
	<p>Below is an interview we did with a renewable/alternative energy profesional, Kate Walker, via email.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>1. What do you do at your job?
I am the Environmental Programs Coordinator for the City of Falls Church. My job is to help protect and improve our air, soil and water quality. I work with government employees, businesses and residents. I try to make sure we spend our money and time in ways that will be good for our environment, now and in the future.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
	2. Why is your job important?
Keeping our city clean and green makes it a safe and healthy place to live. It also makes it more pleasant. That&#39;s very important to the people who live and work in the City. It also attracts visitors, who help our businesses do well. When the City is a good place to live, work and do business, people will invest more money in it and the City will prosper.

</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. What will happen if we don&#39;t use renewable or alternative energy?
I don&#39;t know. Changes in the energy use can have a huge impact on human societies. Have you learned about the Industrial Revolution?
If we use renewable or alternative energy instead of burning fossil fuels, that may help to reduce the rate of climate change. If we can slow the rate of change, we will have more time to adapt to its effects.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. What school did you go to, what did you major in?
I did a Master&#39;s degree at Virginia Tech. My major was Urban Forestry, how and why we grow trees in cities and towns. I also studied how government policies can protect the environment, and what individuals and communities can do to help.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. How far away do you think alternative energy is from being in our infrastructure?
Alternative energy is already part of our infrastructure. There are at least fourteen houses and two businesses in the City of Falls Church that have solar panels on their roofs. The Easter Seals building on Hunton Avenue also has geothermal wells. The wells can take heat from the sun that has been stored in the ground during summer to help heat the building in the winter.
However, there are a lot more places we could put alternative energy sources. Where do you think we could put more solar panels in the City of Falls Church?
The new Discovery School in Arlington has geothermal wells. Could we build some for our schools?
Is wind power an option in Falls Church? What about water?
</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. When do you believe we will run out of Fossil Fuels?
I don&#39;t believe we will run out of fossil fuels. However, as we use them up, it becomes more difficult, dangerous and expensive to get them out of the ground. When energy from fossil fuels costs more than energy from other sources, we will gradually stop using them.
One problem we have is that people can easily see how much money it costs to use fossil fuel &ndash; just read the gas pump or the electricity bill. It is much harder to see the environmental costs. How can we put a price on a hotter summer with more storms, or dirty air and water?
</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. How could an individual support alternative energy?
One form of alternative energy we can all use is our own. We can walk or bicycle instead of using a car. One of the reasons I work for the City is because I can walk to work. Could you walk or ride your bike to school, or to visit a friend&#39;s house?
Homeowners can use the power of the sun in different ways. They may be able to install solar panels on the roof to generate electricity or to heat water. They can buy lights with built-in solar panels for the yard or patio. Building a new home or making major alterations is a good opportunity to plan window size and placement to use heat from the sun directly. Some homeowners can even install geothermal wells.
Individuals can also support alternative energy by writing to their government representatives and asking them to support it. They can also speak out at public meetings. Did you know you could come and speak directly to our City Council about alternative energy at any of their regular meetings?
Voters can choose politicians who support alternative energy. You can help the voters you know learn about alternative energy and encourage them to make energy policy part of how they decide who to vote for.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>8. Any advice for the next generation relating to alternative energy?
Alternative energy sources are important. However, we can also do a lot to reduce fossil fuel use by improving energy efficiency. For example, you can use window blinds or plant a shade tree in your yard to keep your house cooler in summer and use less energy for air conditioning. What other ways can you find to save energy at home? How could your school improve energy efficiency?
Government policy has a big effect on energy generation and use. My advice is to get informed and involved now, and vote as soon as you can.
